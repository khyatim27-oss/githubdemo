Drop to your hands and knees, take cover under a sturdy table or desk, and hold on to it until the shaking stops.

Remain inside if you are already there, away from windows, fireplaces, and heavy, unsecured furniture.

<li><b>Protect Head and Neck:</b></li>
If no shelter is nearby, cover your head and neck with your arms.
